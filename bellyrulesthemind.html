                    My darling, if you marry me, I will promise to hunt 10 mices everyday and 
                    we will have 10 bbq mices on table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                    My darling, I will promise to buy a house nearby a cockroach playground 
                    that our children can play with and for you to make fried cockroach sandwiches 
                    for their school lunch. I will promise to build a huge fish pool in our house, 
                    so you can bake fish pie for dessert.
